# Motivation

This script creates the SQLite "projectdb2.db" database.

```{r}
library(RSQLite)

fpath = "./"
dbfile = "projectdb2.db"

# if database file already exists, we connect to it, otherwise
# we create a new database
dbcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(fpath,dbfile))
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
drop table if exists projectmgr
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
drop table if exists projects
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
drop table if exists certifications
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
drop table if exists earnedcerts
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
create table projectmgr (
  pmid integer,
  name text not null,
  primary key (pmid)
)
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
create table certifications (
  cid integer not null,
  cert text not null,
  body text not null,
  primary key (cid)
)
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
create table earnedcerts (
  pmid integer,
  cert integer not null,
  primary key (pmid,cert)
  foreign key (pmid) references projectmgr(pmid)
  foreign key (cert) references certifications(cid)
)
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
create table projects (
  pid integer,
  pname text default "No Name",
  budget double default 0,
  pmgr integer  not null,
  primary key (pid),
  foreign key (pmgr) references projectmgr(pmid)
)
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
insert into certifications values
  (1,"PMP","Project Management Institute"),
  (2,"APM","Project Management Institute"),
  (4,"CBAP","International Institute of Business Analysis"),
  (5,"CIPM","American Academy of Project Management")
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
insert into projectmgr values
  (11,"John Wu"),
  (22,"Ann Molloy"),
  (18,"Sandeep Ranghani"),
  (19,"Alicia Knauss"),
  (38,"Roxanna da Silva"),
  (23,"Wagner Ormond"),
  (47,"Margaret O'Shea"),
  (20,"Alden White")
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
insert into earnedcerts values
  (11,1),
  (11,4),
  (18,1),
  (22,1),
  (19,1),
  (47,1),
  (23,1),
  (20,1),
  (20,4),
  (38,5)
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
insert into projects values
  (100,"GOTAM",350000,11),
  (200,"Data Twist",875000,20),
  (300,"Alpha Launch",12500,18),
  (302,"Alpha Arch Design",38000,18),
  (303,"Alpha Dev",125000,18),
  (305,"Alpha Analytics Dashboard",22900,38),
  (811,"Bootstrap Demo",0,47)
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
select * from projectmgr
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
select * from projects
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
select * from certifications
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
select * from earnedcerts
```
## ERD of Project Database 
The ERD for the project database is shown below:
<div style="width: 640px; height: 480px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:640px; height:480px" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/ebf45dfa-7367-428c-98c2-a1905866aff5" id="DgMM7UsVcaCd"></iframe></div>

###Q2.1
List the names and budgets of all projects with a budget of more than $200,000
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT pname,budget FROM projects WHERE budget >200000
```

###Q2.2
How many projects managers are there?
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_project_managers FROM projectmgr
```

###Q2.3
List the names of all project managers who manage at least one project, ordered alphabetically starting with 'A'.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM projectmgr WHERE pmid IN (SELECT DISTINCT pmgr FROM projects) ORDER BY name
```

###Q2.4
List all project names and the name of the project manager.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT projects.pname AS project_name, projectmgr.name AS project_manager_name FROM projects JOIN projectmgr ON projects.pmgr = projectmgr.pmid
```

###Q2.5
What is the total budget of all projects combined?
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT SUM(budget) AS total_budget FROM projects
```
###Q2.6
Which project managers have more than one certification? List their names.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM projectmgr JOIN earnedcerts ON projectmgr.pmid = earnedcerts.pmid GROUP BY projectmgr.pmid HAVING COUNT(earnedcerts.cert) > 1

```

###Q2.7
List the name of each project manager, the number of projects they manage, and the total combined budget of their projects.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT name AS ProjectManager, COUNT(projects.pid) AS NumProjects, COALESCE(SUM(projects.budget), 0) AS TotalBudget FROM projectmgr pm LEFT JOIN projects ON pm.pmid = projects.pmgr GROUP BY name;

```

###Q2.8
How many projects that have a project name that contains the text "Alpha". 
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT pname FROM projects WHERE pname LIKE '%Alpha%';

```

###Q2.9
How many project managers manage projects that in total budget (i.e., the sum of the budgets of their projects) exceed $300,000?
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pm.pmid) AS NumProjectManagers FROM projectmgr pm JOIN projects p ON pm.pmid = p.pmgr GROUP BY pm.pmid HAVING SUM(p.budget) > 300000;

```

###Q2.10
Which project managers do not have any certifications? List their names.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT pm.name
FROM projectmgr pm
WHERE pm.pmid NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT ec.pmid FROM earnedcerts ec);

```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```
